# Addressing Inquiries about History: An Efficient and Practical Framework for Evaluating Open-domain Chatbot Consistency
This repository contains the code for Findings of ACL 2021 paper Addressing Inquiries about History: An Efficient and Practical Framework for Evaluating Open-domain Chatbot Consistency.

Our paper and code will be public soon!

## Overview

We propose the *Addressing Inquiries the History* (**AIH**), an effective and practical framework for open-domain chatbot consistency evaluation. **AIH** contains two stages: (1) during the inquiry stage,  questions about the facts and opinions mentioned in the conversation history are inserted into the conversation between chatbots. (2) during the contradiction recognition stage,  the responses of the inserted questions are collected, and automatic models or human judges can be adopted to decide whether the responses are consistent with the dialogue history.
